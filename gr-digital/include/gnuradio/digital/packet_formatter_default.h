     * \brief Default header formatter for PDU formatting.
     * \ingroup packet_operators_blk
     *
     * \details

     * Used to handle the default packet header. The formatters manage
     * two functions:
     *
     * \li packet_formatter_default::format: takes in a
     * payload and creates a header from it.
     *
     * \li packet_formatter_default::parse receive bits and
     * extract the header info.
     *
     * Another version of the parser is
     * packet_formatter_default::parse_soft that receives soft
     * decisions instead of hard bits.
     *
     * This class is specifically designed to work with packets/frames
     * in the asynchronous PDU architecture of GNU Radio. See the
     * packet_format_async block for formatting the headers onto
     * payloads and packet_parse_b and packet_parse_f blocks for
     * parsing headers in a receiver.
     *
     * The Packet Format block takes in a PDU and uses a formatter
     * class derived from this class to add a header onto the
     * packet. The Packet Format blocks takes in the PDU, unpacks the
     * message, and passes it to a formatter class' format function,
     * which builds a header based on the payload. The header is
     * passed back and emitted from formatter block as a separate
     * output. The async format block, packet_format_async, has two
     * message output ports. The 'header' port passes the header out
     * as a PDU and the 'payload' passes the payload out as a PDU. The
     * flowgraph can then separately modulate and combine these two
     * pieces in the follow-on processing.
     *
     * The packet_sync_b and packet_sync_f blocks use the same
     * formatter class by calling the 'parse' or 'parse_soft' to parse
     * the received packet headers. These parser blocks are sinks for
     * the data stream and emit a message from an 'info' port that
     * contains an PMT dictionary of the information in the
     * header. The formatter class determines the dictionary keys.
     *
     * This is the base class for dealing with formatting headers for
     * different protocols and purposes. For other header formatting
     * behaviors, create a child class from here and overload the
     * format, parse, parse_soft, and parsing state machine functions
     * as necessary.
     *
     * The default header created in this base class consists of an
     * access code and the packet length. The length is encoded as a
     * 16-bit value repeated twice:
     *
     * \verbatim
         | access code | hdr | payload |
       \endverbatim
     *
     * Where the access code is <= 64 bits and hdr is:
     *
     * \verbatim
         |  0 -- 15 | 16 -- 31 |
         | pkt len  | pkt len  |
       \endverbatim
     *
     * The access code and header are formatted for network byte order.
     *
     * This header generator does not calculate or append a CRC to the
     * packet. Use the CRC32 Async block for that before adding the
     * header. The header's length will then measure the payload plus
     * the CRC length (4 bytes for a CRC32).
     *
     * The default header parser produces a PMT dictionary that
     * contains the following keys. All formatter blocks MUST produce
     * these two values in any dictionary.
     *
     * \li "skip samps": the number of samples between the end of the
     * last payload and the beginning of this payload. This is used by
     * a decoder block to know where in the payload to begin
     * demodulating the payload.
     *
     * \li "payload bits": the number of bits in the payload. The
     * payload decoder will have to know how this relates to the
     * number of symbols received.
     *
     * \sa packet_formatter_counter
     * \sa packet_formatter_1
     * \sa packet_formatter_ofdm
