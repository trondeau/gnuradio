     * \brief Uses a header formatter to append a header onto a PDU.
     * \ingroup packet_operators_blk
     *
     * \details

     * This block takes in PDUs and creates a header, generally for
     * MAC-level processing. Each received PDU is assumed to be its
     * own frame, so any fragmentation would be done upstream in or
     * before the flowgraph.
     *
     * The header that is created and transmitted out of the 'header'
     * message port as a PDU. The header is based entirely on the \p
     * formatter, which is a packet_formatter_default or a child
     * class. All of these packet header formatters operate the same:
     * they take in the payload data as well as possible extra
     * metadata info about the PDU; the formatter then returns the
     * output PDU as a PMT argument along with any changes to the
     * metadata info PMT.
     *
     * For different packet header formatting needs, we can define new
     * classes that inherit from the packet_formatter_default block
     * and which overload the packet_formatter_default::format
     * function.
     *
     * \sa packet_formatter_default
     * \sa packet_formatter_counter
     *
     * This block only uses asynchronous message passing interfaces to
     * receiver and emit PDUs. The message ports are:
     *
     * \li in: receives PDUs for the frame payload
     * \li header: the header formatted for the given frame
     * \li payload: the payload
